# High-frequency Trading bot
**Note : This project is in early alpha stage, has mostly been put on hold and was never meant to be shared publicly.** 

**I am temporarily making it public in order for potential recruiters to see the work I've done during my career hiatus.**

My attempt at making a high-frequency trading bot. It uses the [Trader Workstation C# API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/index.html) made by [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/home.php). 

To be able to compile and run the code of this repository, you need to :

- have an Interactive Broker account
- have a valid market data subscription (paid)
- install [Trader Workstation](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/trading/tws.php#tws-software) or [IB Gateway](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/trading/ibgateway-latest.php).
- install the [TWS API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/).
